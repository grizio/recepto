## Get started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost.
To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`.
